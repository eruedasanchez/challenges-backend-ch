## Installation

This is a [Node JS](https://github.com/nodejs/node) module available through the npm registry.

Before installing, download and install Node.js. Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

## Description

1. The persistence layer is modified to incorporate the concepts of **Factory**, **DAO** and **DTO**.

2. The **Repository/Service** pattern is implemented to work with the DAO in the business logic.

3. The `/current` path is modified to avoid sensitive information by applying a user DTO with only the necessary information.

4. An authorization middleware is created, which works together with the `current` strategy to create an authorization system and delimit access to the following endpoints:
- Only the administrator is authorized to create, update and delete products.
- Only the user can send messages to the chat.
- Only the user can add products to their cart

5. A **Ticket model** is created to carry out all the purchase formalities. This model has the following fields:
- code: Autogenerated and unique String
- purchase_datetime: Stores the exact date and time in which the purchase was formalized
- amount: Total value of the purchase made
- purchaser: Email of the user associated with the cart

Additionally, in the cart router, `/:cid/purchase` route is implemented that allows the purchase process to be completed. For each product:
- If you have enough stock, the selected quantity of said product in the cart is subtracted
- If you do not have enough stock, the product is not added to the purchasing process

6. **Ticket service** generates a ticket with the purchase data. In case the purchase is not completed (there is not enough stock of a product), an array is returned with the ids of the products that could not be processed.

7. Finally, in the selected cart those that were purchased are filtered and those that are not available remain.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to run this project with express is run the commands to generate an application as shown below:

Create a folder in your desktop directory with the name you want (E.g: challenges-backend-ch):

```bash
$ mkdir challenges-backend-ch
```

Open the contents of that folder:

```bash
$ cd challenges-backend-ch
```

Clone the repository in that folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eruedasanchez/challenges-backend-ch.git
```

Open preentrega-03 folder and install dependencies: 

```bash
$ cd preentrega-03
$ npm install
```

Start nodemon and server with MongoDB persistence:

```bash
$ npm run dev -p mongodb
```

or start nodemon and server with FS persistence:

```bash
$ npm run dev -p fs
```

View the website at: http://localhost:8080/chat for chat application.

<br>
Visit the website at: http://localhost:8080/ to register as a user, log in and be redirected to the products view.
<br>
<br>
Visit the website at: http://localhost:8080/carts/:cid to view the cart with the specific cid
